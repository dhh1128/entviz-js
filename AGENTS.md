This repo is a port of a sister repo, https://github.com/dhh1128/entviz, which
contains the entviz spec, other important documentation, and the reference impl
of entviz in python. The repos are intended to be sister folders on disk and
may already exist in your dev environment. New features can be added here,
but should never violate the specification or the documentation about the
entviz technology that have their definitive embodiment in the entviz repo.

## Task tracking: `tick`

This repo tracks tasks, tech debt, and ideas in a local [`tick`](https://github.com/dhh1128/tick)
ledger (an orphan `tick` branch; the `tick` CLI is the interface). Reads are plain
files — do **not** use an external API for task tracking.

- **First, if a `tick` command says the repo isn't initialized**, run `tick init`
  once to connect this clone to the ledger — it adopts the existing remote ledger
  if a colleague already set one up, or creates a new one otherwise.
- **A tick mark is the sigil `~` immediately followed by a digit-first 4-char
  base32 id** (the id part looks like `4mz3`, so the full mark is that id with a
  leading `~`). It pins a tick to a code location.
- **Before editing a file**, grep it for marks and read what they reference:
  `rg '~[2-7][a-z2-7]{3}\b' <file>` then `tick show <id>`. A mark means recorded
  context exists for that spot — read it first.
- **Search** existing ticks with `tick grep <text>`; **list** with `tick ls`.
- **Capture** new work with `tick add "<title>"` and place the printed mark
  (`~` + the new id) at the relevant code spot.
- When your change **resolves** a tick, run `tick off <id>` and **delete the
  mark(s)** it reports still in the code.

## Testing Protocol

This repository has an established test suite. Follow strict TDD:
1. Write one or more failing tests that capture each requirement (including
   both happy paths and its edge cases/unhappy paths) before implementing.
2. Implement until all tests pass.
3. Never commit unless all tests pass. Coverage of any code you touch
   must not decrease.

## CI and Documentation

This repo has CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` builds and tests on every push
and pull request, and runs a spec-sync + Tier-A conformance check against the
entviz reference. Releases are cut by `scripts/release.py` and published by
`.github/workflows/release.yml` on a `vX.Y.Z` tag.

When writing or modifying GitHub Actions workflows, always use the latest
stable release of each action. Avoid versions pinned to Node.js 16 or
Node.js 20 (both deprecated by GitHub). In 2026, this meant to prefer Node.js
24-compatible versions, but the standard may evolve over time. Check the GitHub
Marketplace for each action's current release.
